Quick, janky crawler-emailer to stay on top of open source projects I use.
Free software gets orphaned every now and then, and we, the end user keep using an unmaintained
and possibly vulnerable software either before we realise that the project is abandoned or a critical CVE gets released.
Change the list with the projects you use, currently only standard GitHub pages are crawled, I will add more, as and when
I get time.
